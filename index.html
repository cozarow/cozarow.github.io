    <p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:35px">hey! i'm <span class="my_name">cerulean ozarow,</span></span> a rising senior studying applied math at brown university. aside from various
        math-adjacent things, my main research interests lie in symbolic systems (broadly writ), educational policy, and
        various aspects of religious studies, although i'm admittedly a little bit interested in nearly everything. 
        in my free time, i like to read, <a href="writing.html">write</a>, <a href="music.html">make and listen 
        to music</a>, and go on adventures.</p> 


    <p style="text-align:left;">this past summer, i worked as a 
    quantitative trading intern at <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">jane street</a>. i also have considerable 
    experience with teaching — i've served as a TA at <a href="https://www.beammath.org/">BEAM</a> and for 
    <a href="https://cs22.io/">brown's discrete math course</a>, and have tutored privately and through programs for
    underserved students in nyc and providence — and have conducted research in language policies in education with
    <a href="https://education.brown.edu/people/pierre-de-galbert">prof. pierre de galbert</a> and language acquisition 
    with the <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/bltlab/">brown language and thought lab</a>, among other projects. 
    currently i'm the co-director of the logistics committee for 
    <a href="https://naclo.org/">NACLO</a>, a linguistics competition for high school students in which i finished in 
    the top 5 nationally in 2020.
