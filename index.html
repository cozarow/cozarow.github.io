    <p>hey! i'm cerulean ozarow, a rising senior studying applied math at brown university. aside from various
        math-adjacent things, my main research interests lie in symbolic systems (broadly writ), educational policy, and
        various aspects of religious studies, although i'm admittedly a little bit interested in nearly everything. 
        in my free time, i like to read,     <a href="writing.html">write</a>
, make and listen to music, and go on adventures. 
    
    this website is intended as a repository for various personal projects of mine, and has also been a way for me to 
    learn how to hand-code a website :) </p>
